                    I grew up in a very musical family with my Grandpa on my Moms side playing saxophone in Iggy Pop & The Stooges, and my Grandpa on my Dads side playing Bass in The Pointer Sisters. This gave me a unique point of view believing that music was a tangible career rather than a far fetched dream from a young age. So as soon as I could, right out of high school I started making moves towards that goal.

                    I started making beats and sending emails to every studio in my area, just asking for an opportunity to intern, and to my surprise it worked. After bouncing around learning as much as I could everywhere I could, I landed a Lead Engineering role for a studio in Oakland called Nexus Audio, after interning for them for a small period of time.

                    I love what I do because I get the opportunity to help others' voices be heard in a creative way. I am EXTREMELY grateful for where I am at, and excited to see where this path takes me next!
